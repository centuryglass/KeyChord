# JUCE Project Template
A template for JUCE projects created and managed without the Projucer, bundled with a large number of support classes that may prove useful. This repository is basically just [Pocket-Home-Bismuth](https://github.com/centuryglass/Pocket-Home-Bismuth) with all application-specific code removed.
