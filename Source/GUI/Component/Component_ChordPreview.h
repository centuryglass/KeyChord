 * beside Component::ChordKeyDisplay. Each column represents an index in the
 * active character set, and each row represents a chord input key.
 *
 *  Each index in ChordPreview's grid is drawn as either a filled square, if its
 * chord key is used with its character index, or an empty square if it is not.
 * The color used to draw the square is a specific configurable color, selected
 * by chord key, whether the square's key is held down, and whether the square's 
 * character is selected or could be selected by holding down more keys.
