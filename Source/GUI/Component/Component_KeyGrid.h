 * @brief  An abstract basis for classes that draw a grid of key values.
 *
 *  KeyGrid is the basis for all classes that draw grids of values using
 * Text::Painter. It tracks the dimensions of the grid, the current held Chord
 * value, and the active character set, so that inheriting classes can access
 * and draw this information. It also tracks the size and padding space used
 * by grid characters, so different KeyGrid subclasses can be aligned fairly
 * easily.
