# Theme Module Documentation
The Theme module handles tasks related to the general appearance of the application. Its primary responsibility is loading UI images and colours from JSON configuration files.

#### [Theme\::LookAndFeel](../../Source/GUI/Theme/Theme_LookAndFeel.h)
LookAndFeel controls how the JUCE library draws UI components. This sets the application font and mouse cursor, and defines custom drawing routines for several UI components. LookAndFeel also loads and applies configurable UI colour values.

## Theme Colours
The Colour submodule loads and sets UI component colour values from the colours.json configuration file.

#### [Theme\::Colour\::JSONResource](../../Source/GUI/Theme/Colour/Theme_Colour_JSONResource.h)
JSONResource defines the [SharedResource](./SharedResource.md) class instance used to manage the colours.json file.

#### [Theme\::Colour\::ColourIds](../../Source/GUI/Theme/Colour/Theme_Colour_ColourIds.h)
The JUCE library assigns a unique ID to each UI component colour value. The ColourIds namespace provides all of these IDs in a single file.

#### [Theme\::Colour\::UICategory](../../Source/GUI/Theme/Colour/Theme_Colour_UICategory.h)
UICategory defines a set of broad UI component colour categories. Each JUCE ColourId value is assigned to one of these categories, and the JSONResource stores colour values for each category. If no specific colour is provided by the JSONResource for a given ColourId, it uses the colour provided by its UICategory.

#### [Theme\::Colour\::JSONKeys](../../Source/GUI/Theme/Colour/Theme_Colour_JSONKeys.h)
JSONKeys provides the list of all colour keys that should be present in the colours.json configuration file. It also converts between ColourId and JSON key values, and looks up the generic colour category assigned to any ColourId or JSON key.

#### [Theme\::Colour\::ConfigFile](../../Source/GUI/Theme/Colour/Theme_Colour_ConfigFile.h)
ConfigFile objects connect to the JSONResource to lookup or change colour values by ColourId value or JSON key.
