# Example Module Documentation
Describe the intent and purpose of your module here. This should be the main place used to document the module as a whole. If the module is relatively straightforward, a few sentences here is enough, but feel free to go into greater depth if necessary.

#### [Example\::Object](../../Source/ModuleCategory/Example/Example_Object.h)
Provide a brief description of the Example::Object class/namespace/enum/etc. This can be directly copied from the @brief tag in the header file's documentation block. Include an entry like this for each header file in the module. Save more in-depth documentation for inside the actual header file.

## Example Submodule 
Describe the intent and purpose of this inner category module within the main module. This should be the main place the submodule is documented, and may be as short or as long as is necessary. Entries for header files or inner submodules within this submodule should be placed below this section. All submodules in the module should be documented with a section like this.
